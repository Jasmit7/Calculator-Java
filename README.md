# Java Calculator

## Overview
This Java Calculator is a comprehensive command-line application that performs a wide range of mathematical operations. It's designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and extensible.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Advanced mathematical functions:
  - Exponential and logarithmic functions
  - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
  - Square root and cube root
  - Factorial
- Memory functions: store, recall, and clear memory
- Percentage calculations
- Unit conversions (e.g., temperature, length, weight)
- Support for parentheses in complex expressions
- Error handling for invalid inputs and divide-by-zero scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Command-line interface or an IDE that supports Java

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the Java files

## Usage
After running the calculator, follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations. Here are some example operations:

- Basic arithmetic: `5 + 3 * 2`
- Using parentheses: `(4 + 5) * 2`
- Trigonometric function: `sin(45)`
- Logarithm: `log(100)`
- Factorial: `5!`
- Memory operations: `M+` (add to memory), `MR` (recall memory), `MC` (clear memory)

## Project Structure
- `Calculator.java`: Main class with the user interface
- `Operations.java`: Contains all mathematical operations
- `Memory.java`: Handles memory-related functions
- `Converter.java`: Manages unit conversions
- `InputParser.java`: Parses and validates user input
